<h1>PHP library for handling client and server-side validation<h1>
<p>This is the custom form validation class written for OTC Web Services. The class consolidates the directives for server-side and 
client-side validation in to a single granular object, allowing for faster deployment and later extension.</p>
<p>The class implements the jValidate library, generating the jValidate rules from its proprietary rules.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Class was developed by the collaborative efforts of Aaron Wright and Brys Broughton of OTC Web Services.</p>
